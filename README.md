# Meetup-Mobile-App
Native Android Application developed at San Francisco State University, which allows the user to search for and display Meetup.com groups based on their current location. The project lasted for one semester and was built from scratch. 

## Main Responsibilities
- Location-based construction of URL query string by using Android LocationManager
  - Relevant files: JsonController.java, GPSTracker.java
- Recording of the short video titled "CSC 413 (Software Development) - CSC Project 2 Documentation", accessible at the following link: https://youtu.be/Jy_ZICNDzks

As the majority of my coding  was focused on location tracking, only that code is displayed here, but other small areas of responsibility include setting up simple accessors and mutators, or discussing how solve an issue with the other team member. Please keep in mind that the organization of the original project has every file organized in folders according to MVC, which this repository does not capture.
